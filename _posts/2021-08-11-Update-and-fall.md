synopsis: Updates on the Psintica Project.

Hello everyone, 
I am aman, I am writing this after such a long time. This should have came long ago but due to my hesitation and circumstances surrounding me I was delaying this again and again. 

I started Psintica with an aim to bring research and pure science education to everyone. I started this on whim but trust me I was damn serious about this. I love science and finding new things in science, nothing can make my blood boil as much as the feeling of contibuting to science does.

I had some plans on how to achieve my target but unfortunately I underestimated the struggles and difficulties in the path which lead this project to its end. 

Yeah, I failed! 

BUT! 

This isn't end. Failure is just the first step. Right now I am learning more from my failure and upgrading my skills in diffenet domains. I'll attack soon with full force again! I won't stop untill I take down this wall infront of me. 

I know no one will read this blogpost but I am still writing this. Take this as me writing a letter from myself. I want to tell myself that this is not end. I will comeback soon. 

I declare this as one of my life goals here! 

I want to bring the joy of contribution to science to everyone. 

Till then, STAY SAFE AND KEEP WORKING!
