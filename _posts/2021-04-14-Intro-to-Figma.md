synopsis: A general introduction to UI Design and FIGMA.

<b>Hello</b>, in this post we'll discuss about UI (User Interface) design and Figma, one of the most famous tools to get started with it. 

Though usually ignored by enetery level developers, good UI Design is one of the most important factors to make your project famous and appealing to the target audience along with good features. 

User Interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. 

There are many things to learn while trying to learn designing. But we will start with the design tool first then move ahead with other things. 

As the saying goes, "A butcher knows his knife more than himself, "  Let's dive staright into the tool you'll use most as an UI/UX designer. 

There are many UI design tools available online, some free and some paid, all with some pros and some cons. 

What I prefer to use is FIGMA. You can obviously try out any other tool and see what fits you. But for now let's try to learn more about Figma. 

"Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows." This is what wikipedia says about Figma and so I would like to explain this. 

Figma is actually just a vector graphics tool. As a designer you need to design vector graphics and then use the art directly or the concept in your project. 

### Why Vector Graphics? 
> Vector graphics are computer graphics images that are defined in terms of points on a Cartesian plane, which are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. Vector graphics have the unique advantage over raster graphics in that the points, lines, and curves may be scaled up or down to any resolution with no aliasing.

In short Vector Graphics can be scaled easily without any loss in qualiy.

Well, That's enough talk for today.
