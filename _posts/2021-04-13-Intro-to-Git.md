## What is Git? 
In simple words, Git is a Distributed Open Source Version Control System. But this simple defintion might not be very simple for many people here, who are looking out for resources to start learning, so let me explain. 

The simple definition can be broken down into various sub terms which can help to understand it better. 

1. Version Control System: As the name suggests a version control system is something that will help you manage the versions of something. Here we typically use Git to manage the versions of code we write. In real world, any coding/programming project is never simple. There are many versions of same program with different features and bugs and with many people working on it at the same time. It'll a tedious task if someone has to manually manage and keep track of all the versions and differences in them. Thus, Git was created to solve this issue and help us in managing our projects efficiently and easily.

2. Open Source: Open Source is simply something that is open to all. Though I said it simply, explaining open source will require an entire post in itself. (Keep an eye on upcoming posts.)

3. Distributed: Something that's not localised. Git is not localised . This means that the code is not just stored in some central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developersâ€™ computers working on a project at the same time. 

## So what is Github? 
According to wikipedia, "GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features." 

Let me break it down. 

1. Github is a private company. Owned by `Microsoft`.
2. It's not owner of Git. As I said, Git is `open source software`. No one holds the exclusiveness over it.
3. It's just like a cloud storage for your code with Git inbuilt into it. Git helps to prevent duplication of code and other management tasks that normal cloud storage won't provide.
4. There are extra features on github, such as issue forums, code wikis, etc.

## Are there alternatives to Github and Git? 
Yes, there are several alternatives to Git and Github.

Alternatives to Git are other `Version Control Systems (VCS)` such as `mercurial` and `Bazaar`. A list of all alternatives can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software). I suggest you to check these.

Alternative to Github are other `Git hosts`, such as `Gitlab`, `Bitbucket` and `SourceForge`. A full list can be found [here](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting). 
> BTW YOU CAN HOST GIT ON YOUR SERVER TOO.

That's all for some basic information. Let's go with some beginners learning resources.
